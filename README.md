# Score Keeper Project

This is my third project where I created a ping pong score board using Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JS

Please check this project live https://jpmurara.github.io/bootcampProject-scoreKeeper/

In in this project I developed a interactive score board for a ping pong game, using Bootstrap, HTML, DOM and JavaScript.
The project demonstrates the DOM manipulation using some elements as: menu options (option element nested inside of a select element) and three buttons (each of them nested inside a different div). Two of the buttons are responsible to increment by 1 point the score of players 1 and 2, while the third buttons resets the game. The score is incremented until reach the winner score, selected in the menu of options. The winner player score is displayed in green and the looser player score is displayed in red, by adding different classes. Also, the increment score buttons are disabled at the end of the game.
Hours spent in this project: 16h
